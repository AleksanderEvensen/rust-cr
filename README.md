# Rust Console Renderer
This is a very simple render engine for the windows terminal, made in Rust.
Project started as a way for me to learn the rust programming language
This repo will also include some games made with the engine

## Remains to be implemented:
- [x] Basic Rendering
- [x] Input System
- [ ] Shape-Rendering
    - [ ] Circles
    - [x] Lines
    - [ ] Triangles



## Things that would be fucking cool, but probably won't implement
- [ ] 3D
